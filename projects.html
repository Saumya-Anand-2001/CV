            <i>
                <p>Steganography is the practice of hiding a secret message inside of (or even on top of) something that
                    is
                    not secret. That something can be just about anything you want. These days, many examples of
                    steganography involve embedding a secret piece of text inside of a picture. Or hiding a secret
                    message
                    or script inside of a Word or Excel document.</p>
                <p>The purpose of steganography is to conceal and deceive. It is a form of covert communication and can
                    involve the use of any medium to hide messages. It’s not a form of cryptography, because it doesn’t
                    involve scrambling data or using a key. Instead, it is a form of data hiding and can be executed in
                    clever ways. Where cryptography is a science that largely enables privacy, steganography is a
                    practice
                    that enables secrecy – and deceit.</p>

                <p>A computer will typically represent a number using a fixed, finite amount of memory. This can be
                    problematic when precision is important because information is lost when a number possesses more
                    information than the space allocated for its representation can possibly store. Fortunately,
                    Wolfram|Alpha has the power to do computations in arbitrary precision, eliminating the cumulative
                    error that arises when fixed point, floating point or conventional integer representations are used.

                    In computer science, arbitrary-precision arithmetic, also called bignum arithmetic,
                    multiple-precision arithmetic, or sometimes infinite-precision arithmetic, indicates that
                    calculations are performed on numbers whose digits of precision are limited only by the available
                    memory of the host system. This contrasts with the faster fixed-precision arithmetic found in most
                    arithmetic logic unit (ALU) hardware, which typically offers between 8 and 64 bits of precision.

                    A vending machine is an automated machine that provides items such as snacks, beverages, cigarettes
                    and lottery tickets to consumers after cash, a credit card, or a specially designed card is inserted
                    into the machine.[1] The first modern vending machines were developed in England in the early 1880s
                    and dispensed postcards
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vending machines exist in many countries and, in more recent times, specialized vending machines
                    that provide less common products compared to traditional vending machine items have been created.
